Phone notes:

------- To ssh onto the phone:

* install openssh via application manager on phone

* Open up terminal on the phones, input
	sudo gainroot #password is 'danger' if it asks

* Now, input 
	ifconfig

* It will output a bunch of information, you need to find the ip under 'inet addr'

* if ifconfig does not work, access the flatland router (192.168.1.1 admin/admin) and look up the dhcp client table and look for the IP address next to host names Nokia-N900

* Now, open the command line on your computer, and do ssh root@<the ip from above>

* Flatland should live in /home/user/flatland-arg , where you can run the client just as you would on a real computer. If this is not the case, look at the setting up phone section below


------- To setup libraries on the phone (do once):

step 1. ssh into your phone
step 2. add 
deb http://repository.maemo.org/extras-testing/ fremantle free non-free
to /etc/apt/sources.list
i.e.
echo "deb http://repository.maemo.org/extras-testing/ fremantle free non-free" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
note, this repository is good as of 4/11/12
step 3. run apt-get install python python-twisted-web python-pygame python-dbus (or something of this sort)

------- To setup flatland on the phone (do once):

step 1. 
step 2/3. open a terminal and run
chmod u+x copyGameToPhone (you may or mat not need to do this)
./copyGameToPhone <ip address of phone> (this will prompt you twice for the password which should be danger, the second prompt happens after all of the contents have been copied over which takes a while. Note this copies all the unused stuff as well which is harmless but does take a while. See manual steps below for more info. 
step 2 (manual). I'm not sure what files are necessary but I assumee it is just netowkr-client and game/ so copy those onto the phone. 
step 3 (manual). copy flatland.desktop into /usr/share/applications/hildon on the phone. Note this assumes flatland is located at /home/user/flatland-arg (NOTE: as of 4/11/12, the desktop shortcut does NOT work for whatever reason, see manual launch)

------- Launching flatland manually:

step 1. cd /home/user/flatland-arg (on your phone or via ssh)
step 2. ./network-client

------- Random notes:

* to quit the game, hit the camera button to open up the camera app. Now you can get to the window screen and close flatland
* for development, use copySourceToPhone to copy only python script files instead of everything. Alternatively, if doing from ssh, than ctrl-C in remote terminal should work too.

* phones with white tape on the back should all have libraries setup already

* Both the server computer, and the phone must be connected to the flatland-arg network (the one created by the purple router)

* If you have issues with the phone screen turning off once you close the keyboard, you will need to install 'simple brightness app'

http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/simple-brightness-applet/

To install it, after you 'sudo gainroot' do input 'apt-get install simple-brightness-applet'.  You can then open up the applet from the status bar, and check the box that says 'keep display on'.
