Phone notes:

------- To ssh onto the phone:

* Open up terminal on the phones, input
	sudo gainroot #password is 'danger' if it asks

* Now, input 
	ifconfig

* It will output a bunch of information, you need to find the ip under 'inet addr'

* Now, open the command line on your computer, and do ssh root@<the ip from above>

* Flatland lives in /home/user/flatland-arg , where you can run the client just as you would on a real computer

------- Random notes:

* Both the server computer, and the phone must be connected to the flatland-arg network (the one created by the purple router)

* If you have issues with the phone screen turning off once you close the keyboard, you will need to install 'simple brightness app'

http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/simple-brightness-applet/

To install it, after you 'sudo gainroot' do input 'apt-get install simple-brightness-applet'.  You can then open up the applet from the status bar, and check the box that says 'keep display on'.
